    <u><h3>Spray Paint which can turn any surface into touchscreen</h3></u>
    <p>Researchers from the Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, announced Monday that they have developed a system called Electrick, which effectively coats an object with a touchscreen using spray paint that conducts electricity.</p>
    <p>By attaching electrodes to the coated objects, a process called electric field tomography allows an algorithm to measure disruptions to the flow of electricity on the surface when a finger is pressed to it.</p>
    <p>Electrick is able to detect the location of a finger touch to an accuracy of one centimeter, meaning it can sense virtual buttons, sliders and other controls can be sensed. The researchers used a  prototype of an interactive smartphone case to explore other potential uses, such as opening applications or creating a game controller.</p>
    <p>“For the first time, we’ve been able to take a can of spray paint and put a touch screen on almost anything,” said Chris Harrison, head of the Future Interfaces Group.</p>
    <p>They have already demonstrated the technology on irregular-shaped objects, ranging from guitars to steering wheels. The touch sensors mean new functionality—such as adding an effects pedal to the guitar, or a volume control on the steering wheel—can be added to the objects</p>

    <u><h3>Instagram Web Uploads</h3></u>
    <p>The Instagram website on mobile devices was previously only available for browsing photos, liking content, searching, and viewing notifications, but now it's possible to upload photos. A new Explore tab is also rolling out on the web.</p>

    <u><h3>Google Fuchsia Operating System</h3></u>
    <p>Google is apparently hard at work on a third operating system after Android and Chrome OS. This one is an open source, real-time OS called "Fuchsia." The OS first popped up in August last year, but back then it was just a command line. Now the mysterious project has a crazy new User-Interface we can look at, so let's dive in.</p>
    <p>Unlike Android and Chrome Operating System, Fuchsia is not based on Linux. It uses a new Google-developed microkernel called "Magenta." With Fuchsia, Google would not only be dumping the Linux kernel, but also the GPL (i.e. General Public License): the OS is licensed under a mix of BSD (i.e. Berkley Software Distribution), MIT, and Apache 2.0. Dumping Linux might come as a bit of a shock, but the Android ecosystem seems to have no desire to keep up with upstream Linux releases. Even the Google Pixel is still stuck on Linux Kernel 3.18, which was first released at the end of 2014.</p>
